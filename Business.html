								<h3>Overview</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/InGeneral.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								Vendor is an app that allows street vendors and food trucks to easily broadcast their location to potential customers. It works by having the vendor set up a profile which includes the name of their stall, goods sold, menu, and description of thier business. Vendors can also link their website and social media pages. The app also allows users to get directions to your current location once they click on your profile, and if they love your goods they can decide to favorite your stall as well to get notification whenever you go live.</p>

								<h4>Location Services</h3>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								Letting your customers know where you are is a breeze with Vendor. We make it easy for you to broadcast your location to potential customers in one of two ways. The first is that you can create a schedule for as far out as you wish to let customers know where you will be serving. The second way for you to reach your customers is by broadcasting your location live during set business hours of the day or whenever you decide to open for that particular day. You can set what these hours will be on a day-to-day basis and location services will shut off after your listed hours have expired for that day. Location services can always be shut on/off for your own convenience.</p>

								<h4>In-app Ordering (Future Feature)</h3>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> Vendor makes it easy for you to accept online orders through our app. A prominent feature of the Vendor app will be in-app ordering. If you choose to enable this feature, your customers will by able to select items from your menu and order them online through the app. Once users place their order a notification will be sent to your smartphone or tablet where you can accept or decline the order. Once an order goes through your customer can choose to pay in either cash up-front or with several mobile payment option such as Apple Pay. These payment methods can be accpeted by anyone with a bank acocunt and do not require you to have an account of your own to accept those payments. You can also choose to turn this ordering feature on/off at anytime depedning on how busy it is or set a limit on how many orders can be taken per menu item per day.

								<h4>In-app Advertising (Future Feature) </h3>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>Vendor make it easy for you to effectively advertise to potential customers who want your goods, are looking for your goods, and are most liekly to spend money at your stall. We do this by allowing you to purchase highly targeted ads that will be shown to users who will most likely want to purchase goods from your stall or truck. We are able determine how likely users are to purchase form you by gathering data on them such as their purchaseing habits, time of day they typically purchase from vendors, location data, and thier personal preferences and past transactions. This makes it so your advertiseing dollars are being well spent and are being converted to paying customers as effectively as possible. So ditch wasteful spending on Instagram and Twitter ads, and instead think of advertiseing with Vendor. </p>
